    <br>
    Good morning. In less than an hour, students from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest AP Test in this history of calculus.
    <br>

Caclulus that -- word should have new meaning for all of us today.
<br>
We can't be consumed by test retakes anymore.
<br>
We will be united in our common AP Practice.
<br>
Perhaps its fate that today is an A day, and you will once again be fighting to learn, not for grades, fun, or because Winheim popped in -- but to pass the AP test.
<br>
We're fighting for our right to college calculus, to avoid algebra 2.
<br>
And should we learn the day, A days will no longer be known as the best day, but as the day when the class declared in one voice:
<br>
"We will not work quietly for Mr. Brophy!
<br>
We will not integrate without a +C!
<br>
We're going to show our work!
<br>
We're going to derive!"
<br>
Today, we celebrate our A days!
